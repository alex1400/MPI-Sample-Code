MPI implementation for N-Body problem

Content:

- nbody		Contains sequential version of the N-body algorithm, parallel version of the N-body algorithm with the name of nbody-par.

- docs		We place there our report.

- bin		Contains nbody-sanity-check (comparison with expected output)



The N-body problem is simply to compute the trajectory of objects in space as driven by gravitational forces. You can find more details about the problem here. Your task is to convert the sequential program we provide into a parallel program using C and the MPI (Message Passing Interface) communication library. The application has to be run and benchmarked on the DAS4.
