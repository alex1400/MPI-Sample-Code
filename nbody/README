MPI implementation for N-Body problem

Content:

- nbody		Contains sequential version of the N-body algorithm, parallel version of the N-body algorithm with the name of nbody-par.

- docs		We place there our report.

- bin		Contains nbody-sanity-check (comparison with expected output)



The N-body problem is simply to compute the trajectory of objects in space as driven by gravitational forces. 
You can find more details about the problem in wikipedia. We convert the sequential program into a parallel 
program using C and the MPI (Message Passing Interface) communication library. The application is ran and benchmarked 
on the DAS4.
